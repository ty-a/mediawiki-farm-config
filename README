This is some wikifarm config that I've been playing with

Requirements: 
For global blocking, create the globalblocking database and follow steps on https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:GlobalBlocking

Wikifactory
Create a database called wikifactory, use the schema in the sql folder in Wikifactory repo
Either make tables or hope for Schema update from Wikia
The required Wikia files for Wikifactory are in the dependencies folder, move them to the extensions folder
